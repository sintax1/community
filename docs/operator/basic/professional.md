# Professional license

#### Designed for those who want continuous cutting-edge TTPs

---

The Operator Professional license is designed for red, blue or purple team members,
penetration testers, security engineers or others who are looking to perform offensive security 
in a professional setting. In addition to all Community benefits, the Professional license 
includes the below features.

### TTP Tuesday subscription

---

Every Tuesday, the Prelude security team releases a new [TTP chain](https://chains.prelude.org) containing a handful of procedures 
that work together achieving a goal. The chains load into Operator automatically and can be run immediately upon receipt. 
Chains may come bundled with custom agents or designed for specific operating systems and many come with "man pages" explaining them in detail.
The idea is simple: every Tuesday review the new chain and run a focused security assessment in your environment. 


### Private support

---

Professional license holders gain access to a private Discord channel where they can get 1-on-1 support from the Prelude team. Additionally, those in the channel are invited to our cohort
meeting - every 6 weeks - where the Prelude team demos upcoming features and talks about the roadmap.
