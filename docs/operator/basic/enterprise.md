# Enterprise license

#### For those working on a team or running continuous security testing

---

The Operator Enterprise license is designed with three cases in mind:
- Work on a red or purple team and want a "team server" environment
- Want hands-off, API-driven continuous security testing
- Run classroom style security training

The Enterprise license is a package of 5 individual Professional licenses on top of the features below.

### Team server

---

From the Connect section, you can connect multiple individual Operator instances so your team can 
see and interact with your remote agents from their own desktop. While connected, you can also:

- Schedule chains to run against your agents while you're offline. 
- Sync TTPs, payloads, plugins and more across your team.
- Use the self-hosted chat feature as an encrypted communication channel during a red team exercise.

### Private Outpost server

---

Every time you boot up Operator, it contacts Prelude's [Outpost servers](https://feed.prelude.org/p/a-drop-in-the-bucket)
which are simple wrapper APIs for our community and professional git repositories. The TTPs, payloads, plugins and training 
programs (we call this a "bucket repo") available to you load into your app. Enterprise license holders 
get a copy of the Outpost source code and the ability to attach it to their account. This allows you to host your own private
collection of resources. Create your own TTPs or even your own training programs. Anything inside your Outpost 
will automatically sync across your team.

### Team management

---

Operator uses a backend web stack to manage authentication called [Headquarters](https://login.prelude.org) (HQ).
HQ supplies team management features for Enterprise accounts. You can add/remove seats on your account and keep an eye on the 
training progress of your team.
