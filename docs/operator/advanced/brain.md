# How the planner works

#### Intelligent Decision-Making At Scale

---

The planner is a multi-level finite state machine which determines the TTP order when a chain is deployed. The
procedures inside a chain are naturally unordered. Once deployed, it looks at the planner for a decision
every time a decision is needed. The finite state algorithm organizes all TTPs into a *kill-chain* based by ATT&CK tactic and then again by technique. Then, it executes one tactic at a time until it exhausts
all TTP files in a given chain.

### Always learning

---

When a chain executes, it collects information which Operator can learn from. As this info is
processed, it is fed back into the planner, often opening up a previously closed state. For example, say the planner
is currently busy executing decisions for a chain, which has completed the first two tactical states above,
and it is executing procedures under Discovery. If the planner learns something which can unlock a "defense evasion"
procedure it will instruct the chain to drop out of the discovery state and into the defense evasion one in
order to do the newly discovered action.

### Continued research

---

The planner is a deep area of research for the internal team. Currently, the team is developing
more intelligent planners, which consider more than order when exiting and entering states. If
