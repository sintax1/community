# What is an agent

#### Remote access trojans

---

An agent, often referred to as a Remote Access Trojan, is a process running on a remote computer which can run commands while under the control of a bad actor.
Agents beacon into Operator periodically to ask for instructions to run. Each agent is
automatically grouped into a range. Agents communicate to Operator through one of several network protocols, 
such as TCP, UDP, or HTTP.

### What is ThirdEye?

---

ThirdEye is a NodeJS agent that is built directly into Operator. When Operator starts, ThirdEye automatically launches
and beacons into your Home range with the username of the user running the desktop application. It only communicates
locally to Operator and is designed for testing TTPs out before deploying them in the wild. 
ThirdEye does not support reverse shells nor can you delete this agent.

### What is Pneuma?

---

Our most popular open-source agent is called Pneuma, a Golang agent which supports all major operating systems 
and 3 different protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP). Pneuma is capable of executing nearly all TTPs and chains loaded into
Operator, along with built-in support for reverse shells (when connected over TCP).

### Additional agents

---

Prelude supports multiple script agents written in various languages. 
Some agents are designed for specific operating systems while others are multi-platform. 
You can find details about these agents in the main section, including download options to start using them.

### Agent ranges

---

Ranges are logical groupings of agents. For example, a range can be used to cluster agents from various platforms (darwin, 
linux, windows) in order to run a cross-platform chain against all the agents. Agents can be moved between ranges using 
either command line flags or the Update Config sidebar in the main section.

### Locking an agent

---

Lock an agent in order to approve or reject each instruction (TTP) before it is picked up and executed. 
When an agent is locked, all instructions will enter pending state where you can approve or reject them one at a time.

### Simulation mode

---

You can set agents to "Simulation Mode" via the agent config sidebar. Simulation mode will run TTPs using output data from
the Expected Output section of the TTP's man page. When you toggle this mode, the chain will run as normal, but not actually
execute tasks on the endpoint.

### Agent facts

---

Each agent collects and manages its own collection of facts, which it will use as variables inside TTP commands.
You can interact with these facts by clicking into the Knowledge Store. You can supply an agent with new facts
manually or the agent can report facts itself through the Beacon object.
    
### Deleting an agent

---

When you delete a file-based agent, like Pneuma, the connection is stopped and the agent is archived - meaning
it will no longer show up inside Operator but the data remains in your workspace, if you need to restore it.
However, if you don't stop the agent's process on the compromised machine, the agent will just beacon back in
and create a new version of itself. To stop the process, you will need to send the agent an "exit" keyword command.
You can do this by using the "Stop Agent Process" procedure. Run this, then delete the agent to completely block it.

### Build your own agent

---

You can write your own agent in any language easily. Follow this simple interface to do so. Hint: if you enable 
plain-text encryption in the Settings section you can copy the below commands 
into a terminal to get a real agent online. 
The required Beacon properties are: name, target, location, platform, executors, range, sleep.

#### HTTP Agent 1st beacon to Operator

```shell
curl -X POST localhost:3391 -d '{
    "Name":"david",
    "Target":"127.0.0.1:3391",
    "Hostname":"whoami",
    "Location":"/tmp/here",
    "Platform":"darwin",
    "Executors":["sh"],
    "Range":"home",
    "Sleep":60,
    "Pwd":"/Users/me",
    "Executing":"",
    "Links":[],
    "Facts":[]
}'
```

#### Operator responds with instructions

```shell
{
    "links":[
        {
            "ID": "c1883712-c81b-40a8-952d-a15123c034c6",
            "Executor":"sh",
            "Request":"arp -a",
            "Payload":""
        }
    ]
}
```

#### HTTP Agent executes instructions and sends a new beacon

```shell
curl -X POST localhost:3391 -d '{
    "Name":"david",
    "Target":"127.0.0.1:3391",
    "Hostname":"whoami",
    "Location":"/tmp/here",
    "Platform":"darwin",
    "Executors":["sh"],
    "Range":"home",
    "Sleep":60,
    "Pwd":"/Users/me",
    "Executing":"",
    "Links":[
        {
            "ID": "c1883712-c81b-40a8-952d-a15123c034c6"
            "Executor": "sh",
            "Payload": "",
            "Request": "arp -a",
            "Response": "some response",
            "Status": 0,
            "Pid": 123
       }
    ],
    "Facts":[]
}'
```
