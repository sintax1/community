# What is a TTP

#### ATT&CK-based tactics, techniques and procedures

---

A TTP is a specific ATT&CK technique implementation (procedure). Each TTP defines an independent
ability a chain could contain, along with classification details describing what operating systems it
will work on. Prelude natively supports Windows, Linux and MacOS (darwin) platforms and a series of shell
and non-shell executors (i.e., the things that run the commands).

### How it works

---

When you deploy a chain against a range of agents, Operator will look at each TTP inside the chain and
match up the platforms and executors to the agent. It first checks for an exact match of platform and executor,
if none are found, it checks the global platform for a matching executor. Only if a match is found will the TTP
be sent to the agent.

### Supported platforms & executors

---

There are three supported platforms: windows, linux and darwin (another word for MacOS). For each platform, there are a 
number of available executors. Not every executor will work on every platform. When you build a custom TTP, you can 
assign it an existing executor or you can create a new one - your agent just needs to understand how to work with it (as the 
executor is sent alongside the command).

Below are some common executors you'll see in Operator:

- sh: bash command
- psh: Powershell
- pwsh: PowerShell core
- python: Python script
- node: Node script
- keyword: user-defined ([read our blog post](https://feed.prelude.org/p/keywords-to-the-kingdom-simple-modular))

### Community license

---

Prelude ships with an open-source collection of TTP files with the Community license. Your application will check at
start up for any new TTPs merged into Community and load them automatically. If you want to add your own procedure files,
you can either submit pull requests to Community or create similar YML files locally.

### Professional license

---

There is a closed-source Professional license which is available under our licensing options in the Account section. This repository contains
additional TTPs. The TTPs also contain additional non-shell executors not available in Community.
