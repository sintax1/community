### A hacker's perspective

---

PSTools is a swiss-army knife on a Windows computer, for handling processes. It has many good uses for a systemsadministrator, many of which can be used for bad in the hands of a hacker. By default, PSTools is not installed onWindows, which means the first thing I need to do is download it. The tool itself is often whitelisted, meaning thatI won't get blocked by downloading it. Because of this, in this procedure I simply download it in plain sight fromthe reputable sysinternals website. Then I install the tool.

### Expected output

---

This procedure will not output any usable content to parse.

### Basic variations

---

The largest variation here will be how the binary itself is downloaded to disk. It could be directly from thesysinternals site or it could be through a proxy or alternative "side-loading" behavior to get the PSTools.zip onthe computer.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Blacklist the sysinternals website entirely to block the download of PSTools.zip. In addition, ensure any installationof new software is monitored. The only computer users who should be authorized to install or use PSTools should beon your technical teams, specifically in IT or security. Finally, be on the lookout for installations which are doneinto your TEMP directory, as this is an abnormal location to install software, almost always related to malicious activity.

### How it is chained

---

Inside of PSTools reside many utilities a competent hacker will salivate over: PsExec being near the top.PsExec is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with fullinteractivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software. This tool can beleveraged for lateral movement. Because of that, look for any Service Execution (T1569.002) commands that follow thePSTools installation. Also look for any commands which invoke the "psexec" utility by name. Lateral movement overRemote Services (T1021) could also be directly chained from this procedure.
