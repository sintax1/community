### A hacker's perspective

Similar to finding the active user, finding all local accounts on a machine gives me a good idea of where and whatI should be looking for. Most of the time, on a compromised workstation (laptop), the only usable local user isthe active user account. On servers however, there are often a multitude of users. I'm generally looking foraccounts that I can iterate over to look in home directories and capture usernames. My best case scenario isfinding an old user account that I can take over without anyone suspecting. Creating a new user account on asystem/network is pretty visible, whereas scooping up an unused account can fly under the radar.

### Expected output

A list of all usernames which can log into the computer are printed to console.

### Basic variations

There are many ways to execute this procedure. An adversary can directly query the information from the system ornetwork, or they can indirectly get it by accessing a file which would contain all user accounts (like the /etc/passwdfile on *nix machines).

### Prevent + Detect

There are no good detection rules which will also have low false positive rates. The best action a defender can takeis to ensure no inactive accounts exist on any systems and the Principle of Least Privilege is followed. Thisprinciple states that a subject should be given only those privileges needed for it to complete its task. If asubject does not need an access right, the subject should not have that right.

### How it is chained

Similar to finding the active user, there are any number of procedures which could follow this one, logically.However, there are two common tactics an adversary is looking to achieve through running this specific procedure:Are there accounts that are under-utilized that can be taken over (T1087)? Do any of the accounts have access thatthe current user does not have? On Linux adversaries will be looking for users with "sudo-less" access, meaningthey can drop to root access without a password. This is a common shortcut sysadmins use to avoid the hassle oftyping long passwords.
