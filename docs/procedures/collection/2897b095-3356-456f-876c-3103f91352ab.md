### A hacker's perspective

A computer clipboard often stores usernames and passwords, particularly if a user has a password manager on their system.I'll run a background process to periodically collect the contents of the clipboard and dump it to a file that I cananalyze for usernames and password. This pair well with a keylogger because I can collect passwords that are enteredvia keystrokes and passwords that are copy pasted from a password database.

### Expected output

The contents of the clipboard will be dumped to a temporary file with the extension prelude.clipboard.

### How it is chained

Capturing the clipboard is often combined with a keylogger as it's a simple and effective way to capture passwords thatdoesn't require any administrative privileges. After using the clipboard capture, the adversary will likely attempt toimpersonate the user using their credentials for both lateral movement (T1115|T1021.001) and privilege escalation(T1115|T1078.002) purposes.
