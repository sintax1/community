name: Capture the flag
challenge: |
  Capture all flags in the Introduction program
context: |
  Operator contains several integrated training programs, one which is called Introduction. This program will teach you
  how to get the most out of the Operator platform. Training modules are added frequently, as new features are added to
  the platform. Introduction is broken into different courses, which correspond to
  the sections of the app itself. Each course contains a set of Capture the Flag (CTF) style challenges for you to complete.
  Complete the challenges from the Train section or look for the circular buttons at the bottom-right of each section,
  to view the flags you haven't captured yet. Submit this flag when you are complete.
