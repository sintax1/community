name: Understanding the Connect plugin
challenge: Click into the Connect plugin and use it to deploy a redirector and virtual "compromised" machine.
context: |
  The Connect plugin offers three functions: deploying redirectors so agents can reach your Operator instance over 
  the internet, deploying test computers for you to practice attacks on and offering the ability to link your Operator 
  instance to your teammates so you can share agents. In this flag, you'll experience the first two functions first 
  hand. Head to the Connect plugin, connect to your AWS account and see if you can deploy a redirector and virtual 
  machine. This flag is completed once you've received a beacon from your compromised computer.

hints:
  - Is your AWS account connected?
  - Did you deploy a redirector and confirm it is connected? It should show a green status circle.
  - Did you deploy a virtual machine? You must deploy a redirector first and after it is connected, 
    deploy your VM. In the Operate section, check the ranges to see if you have any agents in a "cloud" range.
blocks:
  Connect to your teammates: |
    The Connect plugin has a professional feature allowing you to connect your Operator instance to your teammates. 
    It works like this: provision and connect to a new redirector then send a teammate the generated host/password 
    information, which they can plug into their Connect plugin. Once connected, any agent that comes in to you, your 
    teammate or the new redirector will be mirrored across both of your Operator instances!
  Capture the flag: |
    Capture the flag (CTF) is a free multi-level program within Training that serves as a more interactive and hands on
    test to navigate through environments that mimic real-world situations. Currently there are 3 levels that increasingly
    grow in difficulty to test your prowess in navigation and collection through foreign environments.
  Amazon web services: |
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a broad set of global cloud-based products, through a secure cloud serviced platform
    that caters to businesses looking to scale and grow. Their three main products include: EC2, Amazon’s virtual machine 
    service, Glacier, a low-cost cloud storage service, and S3, Amazon’s storage system. In this scenario we will be using
    EC2 to provision both our redirectors and virtual machines.
  Virtual machine: |
    Virtual machines (VMs) are "virtual" versions of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage 
    that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer- such as your personal computer. Existing as a computer file, 
    usually called an image, they act like a real computer that can be run in window as a separate computing 
    environment. Virtual machines can run different operating systems from your physical host computers. 
    This makes it easy for developers to spin up new environments and is a useful tool for to run test scenarios.
answer:
  script: Number(Agent.agents.filter(function(a) { return a.metadata.redirector}).length) > 0
