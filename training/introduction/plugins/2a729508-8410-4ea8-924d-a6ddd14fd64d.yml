name: Understanding plugins
challenge: Load the ART plugin and import the Atomic Red Team attack files.
context: |
  A plugin in Operator is an HTML file, containing valid JavaScript and CSS components. Plugins allow you to extend
  or override various components within Operator, putting you in full control of the system. Cyber security engineers -
  or those who have security and software engineering backgrounds - often want to customize and extend popular open-source
  projects. This can be a time-consuming process and any changes may get wiped out in a future update. Plugins allow a
  safe, easy alternative. Engineers can extend using defined interfaces, allowing them to create extendable components,
  leveraging existing code to quickly iterate on new features. Some plugins are available to community members,
  while others are available to Professional or Enterprise license holders.

blocks:
  ART plugin: |
    The Atomic Red Team (ART) plugin provides a quick import of all attack files from the popular ART repository.
    Simply clone the popular Red Canary project (https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and enter your directory
    path in the plugin to convert the files into Operator-format. They will be immediately usable in an attack.
  Publisher plugin: |
    The Publisher plugin allows you to proxy results from your agents to a variety of data sources, such as Splunk,
    Elastic Search, VECTR or even messaging apps like Slack and Discord.
  Reports plugin: |
    The Reports plugin gives you a rich reporting experience designed to lessen the burden of turning red team results
    into action. This plugin not only correlates the results across all your agents, it also analyzes them to
    automatically create security recommendations that you may not be aware of.
  SIEM plugin: |
    The SIEM plugin connects to your Splunk SIEM and supplies an interface to verify if your saved queries (analytics)
    are working or not. Use this plugin to quickly write new analytics and launch adversaries to test them.
  Toolbox plugin: |
    Your toolbox contains all the utilities you use on a regular basis. Operator will keep these tools updated
    so no need to manually pull latest code. Just enter the address of any tool you want to track and Operator
    will clone it into your toolbox and keep it updated. This plugin requires that GIT be installed on this computer.
answer:
  script: Number(Object.values(Attack.attack).filter(function (a) { return a.metadata.source === 'Red Canary' }).length > 0)
  value: 1
