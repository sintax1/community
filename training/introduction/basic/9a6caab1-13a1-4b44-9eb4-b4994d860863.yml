name: Locate a procedure
challenge: Can you find the TTP named "Credentials in Registry" and enter its TTP ID?
context: |
  A TTP in Operator is really the procedure, in the Tactics Techniques and Procedures acronym. Tactics are
  top-level goals. Techniques are specific categories of implementation to accomplish the goal and procedures are
  the actual commands to execute, achieving the technique. There are likely thousands of procedure variations for each
  technique, as hackers will often modify and craft variations of commands to avoid detection. Learning how to
  identify, write and handle procedures is a valuable skill to have. TTPs inside Operator are designed to be easy to
  understand and work with. Prelude stores them in a separate open-source repository, called Community.

  ATT&CK: |
    The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat hunters,
    red teamers, and defenders to better classify attacks and assess an organization's risk.
    Organizations can use the framework to identify holes in defenses, and prioritize them based on risk. Prelude
    organizes all tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) by the ATT&CK framework.
  Community repository: |
    The Community repository has dozens of TTPs, organized by ATT&CK tactics. This repository
    gets new additions consistently and contributions are welcomed. Shortly after new TTPs get merged into Community,
    they will appear here, in the desktop application, ready to be used.
  Professional license: |
    If you have a Professional license to Operator, in addition to the TTPs you get in the Community repository your
    Operator instance will be continuously loaded with hundreds of closed-source procedures.
  TTP identifiers: |
    Inside the Community repo, you will find all procedures organized by ATT&CK tactic. Within each tactic, procedures
    are stored in individual YML files. Each file is named after its TTP identifier, which will match the ID field if
    you open any of them. This ID is used to determine uniqueness for each procedure.
  UUID-4: |
    A Version 4 UUID is a universally unique identifier that is generated using random numbers. The Version 4 UUIDs
    produced by this site were generated using a secure random number generator. Operator uses UUID-4 strings as identifiers
    because they offer a very unique value which can be quickly and randomly generated.
