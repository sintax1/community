name: Understand chaining
challenge: Find the procedure named FILE.IO EXFIL. Notice how the command has a variable inside, denoted by
  the "#{variable}" syntax. What is a procedure name which could fill in this variable with a fact?
context: In Operator, a chain is the full operation of an adversary. The chain is composed of links, which are individual
  procedures used in the attack. While the adversary is in progress Operator continuously attempts to
  learn about the computers it is attacking and parses out information from every executed command. These parsed results
  are called facts. Each fact could potentially unlock another procedure in the adversary profile by matching the fact key to
  any variables in the command field. This means, the output of a procedure can be fed as input to other procedures,
  therefore creating a dynamic operation.

hints:
  - Edit any adversary to bring up the TTP search
  - Search for FILE.IO EXFIL. Locate the variable and note the technique ID required to fill it in.
  - Search for technique T1560.001. These procedures can fill in the variable

  Understanding the chain: |
    Prelude considers each attack a chain, which is composed of 1-or-many links. Each link is a procedure which was used
    within the attack. Each link is given a unique ID, which allows Prelude to track it through the platform and determine
    what happened and how useful it was. As you construct adversary profiles, keep an eye on the variables inside the commands.
    By leveraging how these can connect, you can build chained adversaries that use learned information to execute.
  Read the docs!: |
    The documentation section about chaining is a great resource on the topic of chains, links, facts and variables.
