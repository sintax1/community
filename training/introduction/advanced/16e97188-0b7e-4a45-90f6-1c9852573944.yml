name: Understanding the Connect plugin
challenge: Click into the Connect plugin and use it to deploy a redirector and virtual "compromised" machine.
context: |
  The Connect plugin offers three functions: deploying redirectors so agents can reach your Operator instance over 
  the internet, deploying test computers for you to practice attacks on and the ability to link Operator 
  to your teammates so you can share agents. In this flag, you'll experience the first two functions. 
  Head to the Connect plugin, add your AWS account and see if you can deploy a redirector and virtual 
  machine. This flag is completed once you've received a beacon from your compromised computer.

hints:
  - Is your AWS account connected?
  - Did you deploy a redirector and confirm it is connected? It should show a green status circle.
  - Did you deploy a virtual machine? You must deploy a redirector first and after it is connected, 
    deploy your VM.
blocks:
  Connect to your teammates: |
    The Connect plugin has an enterprise feature allowing you to connect your Operator instance to your teammates. 
    It works like this: provision and connect to a new redirector then send a teammate the generated host/password 
    information, which they can plug into their Connect plugin. Once connected, any agent that comes into the redirector 
    will mirror across both of your Operator instances!
  Amazon web services: |
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a broad set of global cloud-based products, through a secure cloud serviced platform
    that caters to businesses looking to scale and grow. Their three main products include: EC2, Amazon’s virtual machine 
    service, Glacier, a low-cost cloud storage service, and S3, Amazon’s storage system. In this scenario we will be using
    EC2 to provision both our redirectors and virtual machines.
  Virtual machine: |
    Virtual machines (VMs) are "virtual" versions of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage 
    that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer- such as your personal computer. Existing as a computer file, 
    usually called an image, they act like a real computer that can be run in window as a separate computing 
    environment. Virtual machines can run different operating systems from your physical host computers. 
    This makes it easy for developers to spin up new environments and is a useful tool for to run test scenarios.
  Redirectors: |
    Redirectors are standard micro Linux servers that run a "headless" version of Operator. When you provision a 
    redirector, the Operator on your desktop forms a connection over GRPC to the headless Operator on the redirector so
    any agent which beacons to the redirector gets forwarded to your local Operator. Since your headless Operator is the
    same as your local Operator, you can also interact with it over the HTTPS API.
answer:
  script: Number(Agent.agents.filter(function(a) { return a.metadata.redirector}).length > 0)
  value: 1
